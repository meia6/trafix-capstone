algorithm issues & fix:
DONE
-max time change needs a fix, if ratio_NS>ratio_EW also needs to check if the last light ns was green.
--might need new variable, prev_light_state

DONE
--compares with other direction, still the same dynamic light timings but will change according to how heavy other direction is.
-for shorter green light algorithm, if traffic light ns is green then light_advance to math.ceil(ratio_EW) - 1..

DONE
- if prev_time_selector - light_advance == 0, runtime += 6 instead of pass.
- in other words, inverse the if elif statements for this change.


FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
-- is this inversing efficient? 
-- maybe switching too fast, only speed the light at the halfway mark of the lights?
-- or shorten the rate at which we speed up the green light times. (instead of +6, only +3)
