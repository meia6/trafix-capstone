if its a red light, keep the # of cars equal to the previous or larger. 
-fix 

red light scenario:
highest # becomes current cars if that is larger than the previous highest count
if light == red && current > max, max = current
else, skip (pass)


at the end of the red light, set the green light # to the max
then just start taking input from the video without max.
max for each direction, set to 1.
